* Mark as read.
* Star and unstar items by clicking on the stars.
-- Can you edit links via the simpy API? Simpy is a bit of a crutch really. 
Could move away from it and store links as text files, that would make marking 
as read, starring and unstarring, and editing easy. Would have to rewrite the 
javascript bookmarklet though.

* Forms for adding and editing links with markdown preview of description.
* Links to readability views.
* Domain names of items.
* About page.
* Improve the javascript bookmarklet -- markdown preview, correct window size, bigger textarea, some confirmation after posting.
* Use python-markdown 2
* Make it ajax-y instead of CGI. Should never need to reload the entire page.
